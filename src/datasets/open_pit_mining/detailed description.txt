Optimizing Long-Term Open-Pit Mine Production Scheduling

Open-pit mining operations require strategic long-term production schedules to maximize profitability while adhering to physical, operational, and economic constraints. A key challenge is determining when to mine each block of material (ore or waste) to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of the project, considering factors like ore grades, processing capacities, mining precedences, and time-discounted cash flows.

Core Challenge
The mine is divided into thousands of blocks, each with specific attributes:

Ore/waste tonnage: Ore blocks contain valuable minerals (e.g., gold, copper), while waste blocks must be removed to access ore.

Grade: The concentration of valuable minerals in ore blocks.

Economic value: Calculated as revenue from mineral sales minus mining/processing costs, discounted over time. Roughly 20% of blocks are completely made up of ore. The remaining blocks contain a fraction of ore. When not accounting for discounting, the value of a block is propostional to the percentage of ore contained in it.

The goal is to sequence block extraction over multiple periods (years) to:

Maximize NPV: Prioritize high-value blocks for early extraction to account for the time value of money.

Meet processing demands: Ensure ore production stays within mill capacity limits each period.

Respect slope stability: Blocks cannot be mined until overlying layers are removed to prevent pit collapses.

Blend ore grades: Maintain average ore grades within acceptable bounds to optimize processing efficiency.
