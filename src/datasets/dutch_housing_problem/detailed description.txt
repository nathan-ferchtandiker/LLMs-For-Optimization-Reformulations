The data given in the description below are just examples. The model that has to be developed should contain parameters for these values. 

A residential tower consists of several floors. The optimization model has to consider just one of these possibilities. Each floor can have apartments with different areas. 
 
The owner of an apartment can be “corporation”, “investor”, or “private”. There are three important sectors: “social”, “middle”, and “free”. The profit per apartment for the real estate developer is given, and depends on the area of the apartment, the sector, and the owner.  

Here are the design restrictions: 

Percentage of apartments in “social” sector should be at least a certain percentage of all apartments.  

Percentage of apartments in “middle” sector should be at least a certain percentage of all apartments. 

There should be a minimum average area requirement for “social” apartments.

There should be a minimum average area requirement for “middle” sector apartments.

There should be a minimum total area of “social” sector apartments owned by corporations.

There should be a minimum total area of “middle” sector apartments owned by corporations.

There should be a minimum total area requirement for “free” sector apartments.

The Corporation cannot buy apartments in the “free” sector.  

There should be a minimum Percentage of apartments that go to “investors”. 

All apartments on the same floor should be assigned to the same owner class (“corporation”, “investor”, or “private”).   

The aim of the real estate developer is to develop a design (i.e., which apartments on which floor, and for each apartment: which sector and which owner) such that the profit for the real estate company is maximized and all restrictions as described above are satisfied.
