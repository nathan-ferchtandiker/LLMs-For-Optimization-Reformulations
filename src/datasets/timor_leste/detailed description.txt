Timor-Leste, a country with significant rural populations and challenging terrain, faces difficulties in ensuring equitable access to healthcare. To address this, the government aims to optimize the placement of new hospitals to maximize the number of people with access to healthcare facilities within a reasonable travel distance. The goal is to strategically locate a limited number of new hospitals while retaining all existing facilities, ensuring that as many citizens as possible live within a maximum allowable travel distance (S) from a hospital.

Context and Objectives
Challenge:

Many households, particularly in remote areas, lack access to hospitals within a practical travel distance.

The government can only afford to build p new hospitals due to budget constraints.

Existing hospitals must remain operational to maintain current service levels.

Objective:

Maximize the number of people with access to a hospital within S kilometers.

Prioritize new hospital locations to serve the largest uncovered populations.

Key Components
Facilities and Demand
Existing Hospitals: Already operational; cannot be closed.

Potential New Hospitals: Candidate sites where new hospitals could be built.

Households: Represent clusters of people.

Each household has people needing healthcare access.

travel Distance: Distance from household i to hospital j.

S: Maximum allowable travel distance. Households beyond S from all hospitals are considered "unserved."

Decisions to Make
Hospital Activation: Decide which new potential hospitals to open, with a limit of p new facilities.

Household Assignments: Assign each household i to one hospital within S km, if possible.

Critical Constraints
Existing Hospitals Must Stay Open: All current M hospitals are permanently operational.

Limit on New Hospitals: No more than p new hospitals can be opened.

Travel Distance Compliance: A household i can only be assigned to hospital j if the distance is less than S.

Single Assignment per Household: Each household is assigned to at most one hospital to avoid redundant coverage.
