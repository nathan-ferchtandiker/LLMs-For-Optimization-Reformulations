===== REASONING =====
The model assumes binary variables and explicit DC activation, which are necessary for correctness but may be reformulated for efficiency. Recommendations focus on reducing variable count (via assignment indices) and tightening constraints. Critical assumptions (e.g., binary assignments, travel time limits) are preserved to maintain feasibility.

===== ASSUMPTIONS =====
1. Name: Binary Assignment Variables
   Description: The model assumes that assignment variables (y_ij) and DC activation variables (x_i) must be binary.
   Breakable: No
   Reasoning: Each hospital must be assigned to exactly one DC, and exactly n DCs must be selected. Relaxing to continuous variables would allow fractional assignments/selections, which are invalid.

2. Name: Explicit DC Activation Variables
   Description: The model uses separate variables (x_i) to explicitly represent DC activation, independent of assignments (y_ij).
   Breakable: Yes
   Reasoning: x_i can be derived from y_ij (e.g., x_i = 1 if any y_ij = 1). However, the current formulation allows x_i = 1 without assignments, which the objective discourages but does not prohibit.

3. Name: Individual Hospital Assignments
   Description: Each hospital is assigned to a DC individually via binary variables (y_ij).
   Breakable: Yes
   Reasoning: Aggregating assignments for hospitals with shared DCs (e.g., by region) could reduce variables, but individual drive times may vary.

4. Name: Strict Travel Time Enforcement
   Description: Travel time constraints are enforced per hospital-DC pair via T_ij * y_ij ≤ T.
   Breakable: No
   Reasoning: Time limits are critical for blood delivery safety and cannot be relaxed.


===== RECOMMENDATIONS =====
1. Assumption: Individual Hospital Assignments
   Name: Replace y_ij with Assignment Index Variables
   Description: Use integer variables z_j to represent the DC assigned to each hospital, reducing the number of variables.
   Reasoning: Replacing |S|×|H| binary variables with |H| integer variables (z_j ∈ S) reduces model complexity.
   Suggested Change: Define z_j ∈ S for each hospital j, with constraints to ensure T_{z_j,j} ≤ T and exactly n unique z_j values.

2. Assumption: Explicit DC Activation Variables
   Name: Remove Redundant x_i Variables
   Description: Link x_i directly to y_ij to eliminate explicit DC activation variables.
   Reasoning: x_i can be replaced with indicators derived from y_ij (e.g., x_i = 1 if ∑_j y_ij ≥ 1).
   Suggested Change: Enforce ∑_{i∈S} (1 - δ(∑_j y_ij, 0)) = n, where δ is an indicator function (requires solver support for logical constraints).

3. Assumption: Explicit DC Activation Variables
   Name: Tighten DC Activation Constraints
   Description: Prevent DC activation without assignments by adding x_i ≤ ∑_j y_ij.
   Reasoning: Eliminates suboptimal solutions where x_i = 1 but no hospitals are assigned to DC i.
   Suggested Change: Add constraints x_i ≤ ∑_{j∈H} y_ij ∀i ∈ S.
